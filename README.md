### Hello! My name is Meadow Monticello, and I am a mathematician and data scientist. 
### Attached are some projects that showcase my work and research with R, Python, and data visualization. 
### Check below for descriptions of my projects and navigate to their corresponding files. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Visualization
## [Tableau](https://github.com/meadowmont/Portfolio/tree/main/Tableau)
* Here you can find data visualization for a variety of topics/datasets.
* These were accompanied by presentation and analysis.
* The goal is to preserve the data and make designs that capture relationships in the data.
* View my Tableau public [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/meadow.monticello).

# Python
## [RobotNurse - AI](https://github.com/meadowmont/Portfolio/tree/main/Python/RobotNurse)
* This a Python project.
* An agent (a robot nurse) traverses through a hospital maze to make deliveries to different wards.
* The hospital floor is represented by a 50X50 matrix and the agent is contrained by walls, doors, and hallway obstructions.
* The agent can receive multiple commands and prioritizes deliveries in higher-need wards.
* The user can preference A* or Dijkstra's path finding heuristic.

## [Missingness in Healthcare Data Research]()
* I am conducting research of different impuation methods and their strengths and weaknesses.
* While this an ongoing project, visit the Colab Notebook to see the six imputation methods studied.
* View the presentation to see my resarch findings thus far.
* The "framingham" dataset was collected in a ten year heart disease study and was used for initial testing.

## [Machine Learning (ML) Comparisons](https://github.com/meadowmont/Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Machine%20Learning)
* I used machine learning techniques for classification and regression.
* I compared the performance of k-Nearest neighbors, mulitlayer perceptron regressor, random forest, support vector reression, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression.
* Data sets were about a possum population and F1 races.
* [Here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Kscott02/Portfolio/blob/main/Python/F1_Project/DSC326_Final.ipynb) is the Colab link.

# R
## [Parallel Processing](https://github.com/meadowmont/Portfolio/tree/main/R/Parallel%20Processing)
* I researched the effeciency of parallel processing in R.
* I focused on optimization fuctions ran in parallel.
* This is used in engineering and improving the predictive ability of ML models

## [Janitor](https://github.com/meadowmont/Portfolio/tree/main/R/Janitor) 
* This is an analysis of the "janitor" R-package
* It is demonstrated and outlined in the presentation.

## [Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/meadowmont/Portfolio/blob/main/R/HypothesisTestingANOVA.R)
* This showcases hypothesis testing in R.
* The same coding methods can be applied to statistical analysis with a variety of data.

## [Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/meadowmont/Portfolio/blob/main/R/Monticello_Meadow_Hospital_MLR.R)
* I used hospital data and ran multiple linear regression (MLR).
* SImiliar to hypothesis testing, this code showcases strategies to analyze data effeciently in R.
