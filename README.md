### Hello! My name is Meadow Monticello, and I am a mathematician and data scientist. 
### Attached are some projects that showcase my work and research with R, Python, and data visualization. 
### Check below for descriptions of my projects and navigate to their corresponding files.

# Visualization
## Tableau
* Here you can find data visualization for a variety of topics/datasets.
* These were accompanied by presentation and analysis.
* The goal is to preserve the data and make designs that capture relationships in the data.
* View my Tableau public [here]([url](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/meadow.monticello )).

# Python
## RobotNurse - AI
* This a Python project.
* An agent (a robot nurse) traverses through a hospital maze to make deliveries to different wards.
* The hospital floor is represented by a 50X50 matrix and the agent is contrained by walls, doors, and hallway obstructions.
* The agent can receive multiple commands and prioritizes deliveries in higher-need wards.
* The user can preference A* or Dijkstra's path finding heuristic.

## Machine Learning (ML) Comparisons
* I used machine learning techniques for classification and regression.
* I compared the performance of k-Nearest neighbors, mulitlayer perceptron regressor, random forest, support vector reression, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression.
* Data sets were about a possum population and F1 races.

# R
## Parallel Processing
* I researched the effeciency of parallel processing in R.
* I focused on optimization fuctions ran in parallel.
* This is used in engineering and improving the predictive ability of ML models

## Janitor 
* This is an analysis of the "janitor" R-package
* It is demonstrated and outlined in the presentation.
